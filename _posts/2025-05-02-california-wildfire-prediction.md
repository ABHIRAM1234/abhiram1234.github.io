### **Fire in Focus: Analytical Approach to Wildfire Analysis**

In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict wildfire occurrences in Southern California, utilizing satellite and weather data from NASA’s FIRMS API and Open-Meteo. By analyzing over 113,000 instances of wildfire and non-wildfire events from 2020 to 2024, I developed predictive models to identify key factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture that contribute to wildfire risk.

Using ensemble methods like **LightGBM** and **XGBoost**, alongside geospatial and temporal data analysis, I pinpointed significant predictors of wildfires and achieved robust classification results. The model insights provide actionable recommendations for wildfire prevention, resource allocation, and early-warning systems.

You can view the full project and detailed results on my [portfolio website](https://abhiram1234.github.io/Machine-Learning-CSCI-5612-872-Project/).

#### **Key Highlights:**
- Integrated satellite data with meteorological features to analyze wildfire patterns.
- Developed and fine-tuned models including **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **Naive Bayes** for binary classification of wildfire occurrences.
- Achieved an **AUC-ROC score of 0.94** and **85% accuracy**, demonstrating strong model performance.
- Provided actionable insights to improve wildfire management and enhance emergency preparedness strategies.
