## <a name="methodology"></a>03. Methodology & Approach

### My Analytical Thought Process

**Step 1: Problem Decomposition**
I started by breaking down the complex wildfire prediction challenge into manageable components:
- What environmental factors most influence wildfire risk?
- How do temporal patterns affect fire occurrence?
- What spatial resolution provides optimal prediction accuracy?
