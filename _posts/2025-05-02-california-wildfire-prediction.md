## <a name="project-overview"></a>00. Project Overview

I developed a comprehensive machine learning system to predict wildfire occurrences in Southern California using satellite imagery, meteorological data, and environmental variables. This project demonstrates my ability to tackle complex environmental challenges through advanced data science techniques, combining geospatial analysis, time-series forecasting, and ensemble machine learning methods.

The system analyzes over 113,000 instances of wildfire and non-wildfire events from 2020 to 2024, processing data from NASA's FIRMS API and Open-Meteo to identify critical risk factors. Using ensemble methods including **LightGBM** and **XGBoost**, the model achieves an **AUC-ROC score of 0.94** and **85% accuracy**, providing actionable insights for wildfire prevention and emergency response.
