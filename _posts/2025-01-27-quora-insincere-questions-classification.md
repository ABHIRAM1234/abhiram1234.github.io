## <a name="project-overview"></a>00. Project Overview

In the Quora Insincere Questions Classification competition, I tackled the challenge of identifying insincere questions on Quora's platform. The goal was to build a model that could distinguish between genuine questions and those that are insincere, such as loaded questions, rhetorical questions, or questions intended to make a statement rather than seek information.

My solution utilized a **Bi-directional GRU model** enhanced with **pre-trained GloVe and Paragram embeddings**, achieving a **0.705 F1-score** using 4-fold cross-validation and cyclical learning rates for optimal training.

## <a name="challenge"></a>01. The Challenge: Detecting Insincere Questions

### The Business Problem
Quora, as a question-and-answer platform, faces the challenge of maintaining content quality. Insincere questions can:
- **Reduce user engagement** by creating a negative experience
- **Increase moderation workload** requiring manual review
- **Decrease platform credibility** affecting user trust
- **Hinder genuine knowledge sharing** by polluting the question pool

### The Technical Challenge
The competition provided a dataset with significant challenges:
- **Class imbalance**: Only ~6% of questions were insincere
- **Subtle distinctions**: Many insincere questions appear genuine at first glance
- **Context dependency**: Understanding sarcasm, loaded language, and rhetorical devices
- **Large dataset**: 1.3M+ training examples requiring efficient processing

## <a name="solution"></a>02. My Solution: Bi-directional GRU with Pre-trained Embeddings

### Architecture Overview
I designed a **Bi-directional GRU model** that leverages the power of pre-trained word embeddings to capture semantic meaning and contextual relationships in text.

### Key Components:
1. **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Combined GloVe and Paragram embeddings for rich semantic representation
2. **Bi-directional GRU**: Captures both forward and backward context in sequences
3. **4-Fold Cross-Validation**: Ensures robust model evaluation and prevents overfitting
4. **Cyclical Learning Rates**: Optimizes training convergence and model performance

## <a name="implementation"></a>03. Technical Implementation & Architecture

### Data Preprocessing
- **Text cleaning**: Removed special characters, normalized whitespace
- **Tokenization**: Used NLTK word tokenizer for consistent word boundaries
- **Sequence padding**: Standardized input lengths for batch processing
- **Embedding matrix**: Created custom embedding matrix combining GloVe and Paragram

### Model Architecture
```python
# Simplified architecture overview
class BiGRUClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embedding_matrix, hidden_size=128):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(embedding_matrix)
        self.gru = nn.GRU(embedding_matrix.shape[1], hidden_size, 
                         bidirectional=True, batch_first=True)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.3)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        gru_out, _ = self.gru(embedded)
        pooled = torch.mean(gru_out, dim=1)
        dropped = self.dropout(pooled)
        return torch.sigmoid(self.classifier(dropped))
```

### Training Strategy
- **4-Fold Cross-Validation**: Ensured robust evaluation across different data splits
- **Cyclical Learning Rates**: Implemented cosine annealing for optimal convergence
- **Class Weight Balancing**: Addressed imbalanced dataset with weighted loss
- **Early Stopping**: Prevented overfitting with patience-based stopping
