## <a name="project-overview"></a>00. Project Overview

Built and compared four recommendation approaches on MovieLens 1M: content-based filtering, user-item collaborative filtering, matrix factorization (SVD), and a deep learning model. The goal is to understand trade-offs in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability.

---

## <a name="dataset"></a>01. Dataset & Problem

- MovieLens 1M: 1,000,209 ratings, ~3,900 movies, 6,040 users
- Task: predict user preferences and recommend top-N movies
- Inputs: `users.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`

---

## <a name="models"></a>02. Models Implemented

- Content-Based: movie metadata similarity
- Memory-based CF: user-user and item-item similarities
- SVD: latent factor model via matrix factorization
- Deep Learning: embedding-based model for user/movie interactions

Code references: `CFModel.py`, notebooks for each approach.

## <a name="pipeline"></a>03. Pipeline & Notebooks

- `Data_Processing.ipynb`: load/clean/feature prep
- `Content_Based_and_Collaborative_Filtering_Models.ipynb`
- `SVD_Model.ipynb`
- `Deep_Learning_Model.ipynb`

---

## <a name="results"></a>04. Results & Learnings

- SVD provides strong baseline with good accuracy/efficiency
- Deep model learns nuanced interactions but needs tuning and compute
- Content-based is interpretable and cold-start friendly for items

---

## <a name="requirements"></a>05. Requirements

- Python 3.x, Jupyter
- Key libs: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, surprise, keras, h5py, matplotlib, seaborn
