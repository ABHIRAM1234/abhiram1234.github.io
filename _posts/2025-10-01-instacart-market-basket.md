## <a name="project-overview"></a>00. Project Overview

Unified two complementary Instacart projects into one end-to-end solution: exploratory analytics, segmentation, and association rules, followed by a production-grade reorder prediction model deployed as a real-time API.

---

## <a name="problem-data"></a>01. Problem & Data

- Goal: predict which previously purchased products a user will reorder next
- Dataset: multi-table relational data with user orders, products, and timestamps (millions of records)

---

## <a name="eda-segmentation"></a>02. Exploratory Analysis & Customer Segmentation

- Explored product popularity, weekly/hourly purchase patterns, and reorder tendencies
- Built customer segments using PCA + K-Means to capture shopping behaviors and frequency patterns

---

## <a name="association-rules"></a>03. Association Rules & Product Affinities

- Mined frequent itemsets and association rules (Apriori) to reveal co-purchase relationships
- Insights inform candidate generation and promotion bundling strategies

---

## <a name="reorder-model"></a>04. Reorder Prediction Model

- Engineered 30+ behavioral and temporal features (e.g., days since last order, user/product frequencies)
- Tuned XGBoost classifier achieving strong F1 performance on validation
- Dynamic Top-N strategy personalizes number of recommended items per user

---

## <a name="deployment"></a>05. API Deployment (Docker + Cloud Run)

- Packaged as a Flask + Gunicorn service, containerized via Docker
- Deployed to Google Cloud Run for scalable, low-ops serving
- Feature store backed by BigQuery for fast lookups at inference time

Local test example (after running the container):
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
Body: {"user_id": 1}
```

---

## <a name="results"></a>06. Results & Impact

- Accurate reorder predictions enable targeted recommendations and basket growth
- Customer segments and rules guide merchandising and personalized campaigns

---

## <a name="tech-stack"></a>07. Technical Stack

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna
- Notebooks for EDA/feature engineering; Flask, Gunicorn, Docker for serving
- Google Cloud Run + BigQuery for scalable inference

## ðŸš€ Why This Project Matters

Combines analytical depth (segmentation and rules) with production engineering (real-time API) to demonstrate a full lifecycle retail ML systemâ€”from insights to impact.
