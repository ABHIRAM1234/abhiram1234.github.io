## <a name="project-overview"></a>00. Project Overview

I developed a comprehensive, end-to-end employee scheduling automation system for CU BookStore that streamlines the entire process from data collection to shift assignment and notification. This project demonstrates my ability to architect and implement production-ready data pipelines using AWS services, solving a real-world business problem that affects operational efficiency and employee satisfaction.

## <a name="business-challenge"></a>01. The Business Challenge & Strategic Approach

### Understanding the Problem
Employee scheduling in retail environments like CU BookStore is traditionally a manual, time-intensive process prone to errors and inefficiencies. The existing system required managers to:
- Manually collect employee availability from multiple sources
- Match availability against operational requirements
- Handle last-minute changes and conflicts
- Communicate schedules to employees individually

This process was not only labor-intensive but also led to scheduling conflicts, coverage gaps, and poor employee experience.

### My Solution Strategy
I approached this as a **data engineering and automation challenge** rather than just a scheduling problem. My strategy involved:

1. **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Building a robust system to collect, process, and store scheduling data
2. **Automated Processing**: Using AWS services to handle the complex logic of matching availability to requirements
3. **Scalable Communication**: Implementing automated notifications to reduce manual overhead
4. **Monitoring & Reliability**: Ensuring the system could handle real-world scenarios and edge cases

## <a name="technical-architecture"></a>02. Technical Architecture & Implementation

### System Design Philosophy
I designed the system with **microservices architecture** principles, using AWS services to create a scalable, fault-tolerant solution. The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns:

```
Data Collection → Processing → Scheduling Logic → Notification → Storage
```

### Core Components & AWS Services Integration

#### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **S3 Bucket**: Centralized storage for employee availability and shift requirement files
- **Flask Web Application**: User-friendly interface for data upload and system management
- **Lambda Function**: Automated daily triggers to fetch and process new data

#### 2. Processing Pipeline
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates the entire data pipeline with three main workflows:
  - **Transformation**: Cleans and validates input data
  - **Scheduling**: Applies business logic to assign optimal shifts
  - **Emailing**: Generates and sends notifications

#### 3. Data Storage & Management
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Stores processed scheduling data and historical records
- **DynamoDB**: Manages email content and notification templates
- **SQS**: Handles message queuing for reliable email delivery

#### 4. Communication System
- **SES (Simple Email Service)**: Delivers automated notifications to employees
- **Custom Email Templates**: Professional, personalized communication

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why Apache Airflow?
I chose Airflow for its robust workflow management capabilities. The three-stage pipeline (Transformation → Scheduling → Emailing) requires careful orchestration to ensure data consistency and handle failures gracefully. Airflow's DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure perfectly suited this sequential processing requirement.

#### AWS Service Selection
- **S3**: For scalable, durable file storage with versioning capabilities
- **Lambda**: For serverless, event-driven processing that scales automatically
- **RDS**: For structured data storage with ACID compliance
- **DynamoDB**: For fast, flexible NoSQL storage of email templates
- **SQS**: For reliable message queuing with built-in retry logic
- **SES**: For scalable, deliverable email service

## <a name="development-process"></a>03. Development Process & Iterative Improvements

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline
I started by building the core data pipeline:
- Created the Flask application for data upload
- Implemented S3 integration for file storage
- Built the initial transformation logic in Python
- Set up RDS database schema for storing processed data

**Challenge**: Ensuring data quality and handling various file formats (Excel files with different structures)
**Solution**: Implemented robust data validation and error handling with detailed logging

### Phase 2: Scheduling Algorithm Development
The core scheduling logic required careful consideration of multiple constraints:
- Employee availability windows
- Shift duration requirements
- Skill matching and preferences
- Fair distribution of shifts

**Challenge**: Balancing multiple competing objectives while maintaining system performance
**Solution**: Implemented a multi-objective optimization approach with configurable weights

### Phase 3: Automation & Reliability
I focused on making the system production-ready:
- Implemented Airflow DAGs for automated processing
- Added comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Built monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Created automated testing for critical components

**Challenge**: Ensuring the system could handle real-world scenarios like missing data or service outages
**Solution**: Implemented graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

### Phase 4: User Experience & Communication
The final phase focused on the human element:
- Designed professional email templates
- Implemented personalized notifications
- Added self-service capabilities for employees
- Created administrative dashboards
